# IntrusionDetectionML

There has been a tremendous growth of internet based traffic which has led to a wide
varieties of vulnerabilities in the corporate networks. This leads to a lot of intrusive
attacks which affects the smooth operation of network infrastructure by consuming
corporate resources and time. Therefore an efficient way of protection would be to
identify the patterns of these attacks, so we can mitigate them to enhance productivity.
Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a major part of the network traffic security. Machine
learning plays a big role in making IDS automated and efficient over time. 

Hence, I will
be displaying some of those machine learning algorithms for detecting intrusive traffic and
comparing them to find out which of them has leads to the best performance. 

I will be
using the NSL-KDD as the dataset for the said comparative study. A good Intrusion
detection performance has high accuracy level and minimal error rate which can be
determined by precision, recall, F1 score and ROC curve. Four binary classifiers: Stochastic
Gradient descent, Random Forests, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine are tested
and validated to come up with the results. The results demonstrated that Random Forest
Classifier outperformed the other four classifiers.
